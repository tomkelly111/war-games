[War Games](https://tomkelly111.github.io/war-games/) is a website which is optimsied for mobile and is intended to be an entertaining but easy to use game. The game uses minimilist design and clear images to ensure use of the game is as simple as possible. Features such as hiding the "Let's Battle!" button until the user has selected their weapon make sure there is no room for user error. The game also helpfully keeps track of games won and lost and provides the user with their current score.
